# Risk Management Package - pyriskmgmt

The `pyriskmgmt` package is designed to offer a straightforward but comprehensive platform for risk assessment, targeting the calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) across various financial instruments. While providing a solid foundation, the package also allows for more specialized development to meet users' specific investment strategies and risk requirements.

The package is structured into three core modules:
 
- The `equity_models` module specializes in the analysis of individual stocks and portfolios. 
- The `derivative_models` module is tailored for evaluating risks associated with financial derivatives. 
- The `fixed_income_models` module focuses on assessing fixed-income securities.
