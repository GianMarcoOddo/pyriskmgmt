# Risk Management Package - pyriskmgmt

The `pyriskmgmt` package is designed to offer a straightforward but comprehensive platform for risk assessment, targeting the calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) across various financial instruments. While providing a solid foundation, the package also allows for more specialized development to meet users' specific investment strategies and risk requirements.

### Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk is a statistical measure that quantifies the level of financial risk within a portfolio over a specific time period. It estimates the maximum potential loss at a given confidence level.
- More on VaR here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp

### Expected Shortfall (ES)
Also known as Conditional Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall measures the expected value of loss in the worst-case scenarios that exceed the Value at Risk level, at a specified confidence level.
- More on ES here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conditional_value_at_risk.asp


## The package is structured into three core modules:
 
- The `equity_models` module specializes in the analysis of individual stocks and portfolios, with its primary focus on calculating VaR (Value at Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall) for these assets.
- The `derivative_models` module is tailored for evaluating risks associated with financial derivatives, centering its analysis on the computation of VaR and ES for these financial instruments.
- The `fixed_income_models` module is dedicated to assessing fixed-income securities, primarily through the calculation of VaR and ES for bond portfolios and individual fixed-income assets.

# 


## 1. `equity_models`

The equity_models module is designed to provide robust calculations for Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for both individual stocks and portfolios. It employs two primary approaches for these calculations: non-parametric and parametric methods.

The non-parametric methods are encapsulated in `EquityNprmSingle` for individual stocks and `EquityNprmPort` for portfolios. On the other hand, parametric techniques are implemented in `EquityPrmSingle` for single stocks and `EquityPrmPort` for portfolios.
By offering a diverse set of methodologies, this module allows for a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of equity-related risks.
It contains the following classes:

1. `EquityNprmSingle`

    This class is designed to model Non-Parametric Risk Measures for a single asset. The class performs calculations
    for the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using either the quantile or bootstrap method.
    Furthermore, this class also allows for fitting the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to the right-hand tail 
    of the loss distribution to perform an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) analysis.

    > The interval of the VaR/Es calculation follows the frequency of the provided `returns`
    
    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - returns: Array with returns for the asset.
    - position: The position on the asset. A positive value indicates a long position, a negative value indicates a short position.  
      - The position you possess can be determined by multiplying the asset's present-day price by the quantity you hold.
    - alpha: The significance level for the risk measure calculations (VaR and ES). Alpha is the probability of the
    occurrence of a loss greater than or equal to VaR or ES. Default is 0.05.
    - method: The method to calculate the VaR and ES. The possible values are "quantile" or "bootstrap". Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: The number of bootstrap samples to use when method is set to "bootstrap". Default is 1000.

    Methods
    --------
    - summary(): Returns a dictionary containing the summary of the calculated risk measures.
    - evt(): Performs an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) analysis by fitting the Generalized Pareto Distribution 
    to the right-hand tail of the loss distribution. 
    Returns the calculated VaR and ES under EVT along with the shape and scale parameters of the fitted GPD.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - var: float: The calculated Value at Risk.
    - es: float: The calculated Expected Shortfall.

    Example
    -------

    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # importing the yfinance library to fetch financial data
    import yfinance as yf

    # initializing the variable "ticker" with the stock symbol for Microsoft
    ticker = ["MSFT"]

    # downloading historical stock data for Microsoft from 2021-01-01 to 2023-08-08 with a daily interval, without showing the progress
    data = yf.download(ticker, start='2021-01-01', end="2023-08-08", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the downloaded data to get adjusted closing prices
    close_prices = data['Adj Close']

    # calculating daily returns by taking the percentage change between each day's adjusted closing prices, and removing NaN values
    returns = close_prices.pct_change().dropna()

    # EquityNprmSingle class
    from pyriskmgmt.equity_models import EquityNprmSingle
    model = EquityNprmSingle(returns = returns, position = 1251.36, alpha = 0.05, method = "bootstrap")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Single Stock:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Calculates and returns a summary of various risk measures for the given asset.
    This method calculates the maximum loss, maximum excess loss (over VaR), maximum loss over VaR, and the Expected Shortfall over VaR. These measures are used to give an overall picture of the risk associated with the asset. All these measures are rounded off to 4 decimal places for readability.
    ----

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    -  Performs Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to estimate  VaR (Value at Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall). The EVT estimates are calculated using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
    EVT is a method used to assess the risk of extreme events. It is particularly useful for estimating the risk of rare events that are not well-represented in the available data.
    ----

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

---
2. `EquityNprmPort`

    The `EquityNprmPort` class is a non-parametric risk management class designed to provide risk measures for a portfolio of assets.
    The non-parametric approach does not rely on any assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of asset returns. 

    > The interval of the VaR/Es calculation follows the frequency of the provided `returns`.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - returns: A numpy array of asset returns.
    - positions: A list of asset positions.

    - alpha: The significance level for VaR and ES calculations. Default is 0.05.
    - method: A method to be used for the VaR and ES calculations. The options are "quantile" for quantile-based VaR and ES calculation or "bootstrap" for a 
    bootstrap-based calculation. Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: The number of bootstrap samples to be used when the bootstrap method is selected. This is ignored when the quantile method is selected. Default is 1000.

    Methods
    --------
    - summary(): Provides a summary of the risk measures, including VaR, Expected Shortfall (ES), Maximum Loss, Maximum Excess Loss, and ratios of these measures.
    - evt(): Provides risk measures using Extreme Value Theory (EVT). This is a semi-parametric approach that fits a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to the tail 
    of the loss distribution.
    - MargVars(): Provides the marginal VaRs for each asset in the portfolio. This is calculated as the change in portfolio VaR resulting from a small 
    change in the position of a specific asset. Only available if self.method = "quantile".
    
    Attributes
    ---------
    - var: The calculated Value at Risk (VaR) for the portfolio.
    - es: The calculated Expected Shortfall (ES) for the portfolio. 
    - port_returns: Cumulative returns of the portfolio based on the asset returns and positions. 

    Example
    -------

    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # importing the yfinance library to obtain financial market data
    import yfinance as yf

    # defining a list of tickers for Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, and Tesla
    tickers = ["MSFT", "AAPL", "GE", "TSLA"]

    # defining the initial positions in each stock as of the start date
    positions = [-1546.56, 5882.284, -65891.4824, 2824.425]

    # downloading historical stock data for the specified tickers from 2021-01-01 to 2023-01-01, using a daily interval and turning off the progress indicator
    data = yf.download(tickers, start='2021-01-01', end="2023-01-01", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the downloaded data to get adjusted closing prices
    close_prices = data['Adj Close']

    # calculating the daily returns by taking the percentage change of each day's adjusted closing prices, and removing any NaN values
    returns = close_prices.pct_change().dropna()

    # EquityNprmPort class
    from pyriskmgmt.equity_models import EquityNprmPort
    model = EquityNprmPort(returns = returns, positions = positions, alpha = 0.05, method = "quantile")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Portfolio of Stocks:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Computes various risk metrics for the portfolio and returns them in a dictionary.
    This method calculates the maximum loss, maximum excess loss (over VaR), maximum loss over VaR, 
    and the Expected Shortfall over VaR. These measures are used to give an overall picture of the risk 
    associated with the portfolio.
    ---

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    - Estimates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using the Extreme Value Theory (EVT).
    EVT is used for assessing risk for extreme events. This function implements both quantile-based and bootstrap-based methods for EVT.
    ----

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

    Third method: MargVars()
    > only available if self.method = "quantile"
    - Computes the Marginal Value at Risk (MVaR) for each asset in the portfolio using a non-parametric approach.
    MVaR measures the rate of change in the portfolio's VaR with respect to a small change in the position of a specific asset. 
    This method works by perturbing each asset's position by a small amount (proportional to 1/scale_factor), calculating the new VaR,
    and measuring the difference from the original VaR. The result is an array of MVaRs, one for each asset.
    ---
    
    ```python
    model.MargVars(scale_factor = 0.1)
    ```

    import yfinance as yf 

    # defining the ticker symbol for Microsoft
    ticker = ["MSFT"]

    # specifying the quantity of stocks owned
    num_stocks = 5

    # downloading historical daily stock data for the ticker between 2021-01-01 and 2023-01-01, while suppressing the progress bar
    data = yf.download(ticker, start='2021-01-01', end="2023-01-01", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the downloaded data to represent adjusted closing stock prices
    close_prices = data['Adj Close']

    data_test = yf.download(ticker, start='2023-01-01', end="2023-08-08", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the test data to represent adjusted closing prices for the test period
    close_prices_test = data_test['Adj Close']

    # fetching the starting closing price for the test data
    S0_initial = close_prices_test.head(1).values.ravel()

    # determining daily returns for the test period by computing the percentage change between consecutive closing prices and removing NaN entries
    test_returns = close_prices_test.pct_change().dropna()

    # EquityPrmSingle class
    from pyriskmgmt.equity_models import EquityPrmSingle
    model = EquityPrmSingle(returns = returns, position = position, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05) 

    print("Parametric VaR-ES for a Single Stock:")
    print("Simple VaR:",model.simple_var)

    ```

    First method: model.garch_model()
    - Fits a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to the volatility of an equity position. This method measures and forecasts volatility and calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a given level of significance (alpha)
    ---

    ```python
    model.garch_model(p=1, q=1)
    ```

    Second method: model.ewma_model()
    - Fits an Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model to the volatility of an equity position. The EWMA model provides
    a method of estimating volatility where the weights decrease exponentially for older observations, giving
    more relevance to recent observations. It then calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    for a given level of significance (alpha).
    ---
    
    ```python
    model.ewma_model(lambda_ewma=0.94)
    ```

    Third method: model.mcModelDrawReturns()
    - Runs Monte Carlo simulations of future equity returns based on different types of volatilities: 
    simple historical volatility, GARCH model volatility, or Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) volatility.
    It uses the simulations to estimate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). 
    ---

    > Some example of the mcModelDrawReturns() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(vol="garch", mu = "moving_average")
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(vol="ewma", mu = "zero")
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(vol="simple", mu = "constant")
    ```

    Fourth method: model.mcModelGbm()
    - Runs Monte Carlo simulations of future equity prices using a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. 
    The model parameters are estimated based on different types of volatilities: 
    simple historical volatility, GARCH model volatility, or Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) volatility.
    It uses the simulations to estimate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). 
    ---

    > Some example of the mcModelGbm() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelGbm(vol="garch", mu = "moving_average")
    model.mcModelGbm(vol="ewma", mu = "zero")
    model.mcModelGbm(vol="simple", mu = "constant")
    ```

    Fifth method: model.kupiec_test()
    - Performs the Kupiec test of unconditional coverage to verify the accuracy of the VaR model
    The Kupiec test compares the number of exceptions (instances where the losses exceed the VaR estimate)
    with the expected number of exceptions. Under the null hypothesis, the number of exceptions is consistent
    with the VaR confidence level.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.garch_model(p=1, q=1)["var"]
    ```
    > Kupiec unconditional coverage test
    ```python
    model.kupiec_test(num_stocks = num_stocks, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```
       
    Sixth method: model.christoffersen_test()
    - Performs the Christoffersen test of independence to verify the accuracy of the VaR model.
    The Christoffersen test assesses the independence of exceptions. Under the null hypothesis, exceptions
    (instances where the losses exceed the VaR estimate) are independently distributed over time.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.garch_model(p=1, q=1)["var"]
    ```
    > Christoffersen test of independence
    ```python
    model.christoffersen_test(num_stocks = num_stocks, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```

    Seventh method: model.combined_test()
    - Performs a combined Kupiec and Christoffersen test to assess the accuracy of the VaR model.
    The combined test applies both the Kupiec test of unconditional coverage and the Christoffersen test of independence to the exceptions. 
    The null hypothesis is that the VaR model is accurate.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.garch_model(p=1, q=1)["var"]
    ```
    > Combined Kupiec and Christoffersen test
    ```python
    model.combined_test(num_stocks = num_stocks, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # importing the yfinance library to handle financial market data
    import yfinance as yf 

    # defining a list of tickers for Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, Tesla, Amazon, 3M, Google and Meta
    tickers = ["MSFT", "AAPL", "GE", "TSLA", "AMZN", "MMM", "GOOG", "META"]

    # specifying the quantities of stocks owned
    num_stocks_s = [-12.5, 88.8, -276.9, 26.13, 88.65, -98.58, 56.25, -89.25]

    # downloading historical stock data for the listed tickers between 2021-01-01 and 2023-01-01, with daily intervals and without displaying progress

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the downloaded data to get the adjusted closing prices for each stock
    close_prices = data['Adj Close']

    # retrieving the most recent closing prices from the historical data
    prices_today = close_prices.tail(1).values.ravel()

    # calculating the value of the current positions based on the number of stocks and the most recent closing prices
    positions = num_stocks_s * prices_today

    # calculating daily returns by finding the percentage change in adjusted closing prices for each stock and removing NaN entries
    returns = close_prices.pct_change().dropna()

    # downloading another set of historical stock data for the listed tickers between 2023-01-01 and 2023-08-08, again with daily intervals and without displaying progress
    data_test = yf.download(tickers, start='2023-01-01', end="2023-08-08", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting the 'Adj Close' column from the newly downloaded data to get the adjusted closing prices for the test period
    close_prices_test = data_test['Adj Close']

    # fetching the starting closing prices for the test data
    S0_initial_s = close_prices_test.head(1).values.ravel()

    # calculating daily returns for the test period by finding the percentage change in adjusted closing prices for each stock and removing NaN entries
    test_returns = close_prices_test.pct_change().dropna()

    # EquityPrmPort class
    from pyriskmgmt.equity_models import EquityPrmPort
    model = EquityPrmPort(returns = returns, positions =  positions, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05)

    print("Parametric VaR-ES for Portfolio of Stocks:")
    print("Simple VaR:", model.simple_var)
    print("Simple Es:", model.simple_es)
    ```

    First method: garch_model()
    - The 'garch_model' function melds Python and R for efficiency, particularly due to the DCC GARCH models in R.
    The execution of this method requires an active R environment with the 'rmgarch' package installed, which is used to perform the GARCH model calculations.
    If these are not set up, you can download and install R, and then run 'install.packages("rmgarch")' within your R environment.
    This method employs a DCC GARCH (Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to determine the Value at Risk (VaR),
    Expected Shortfall (ES), and the standard deviation of a portfolio. 
    The DCC GARCH model is used for modeling the variance of portfolio returns, taking into account the dynamic volatility that is characteristic of financial time series.
    ---

    ```python
    model.garch_model(p = 1, q = 1, warning= False)
    ```

    Second method: ewma_model()
    - This method applies the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model to compute the Value at Risk (VaR) and 
    Expected Shortfall (ES) for a portfolio of assets. It also computes the portfolio standard deviation.
    The EWMA model is used to calculate a variance-covariance matrix of portfolio returns, giving more weight to recent observations.
    This method can be particularly useful in financial markets that are experiencing significant changes or are highly volatile.
    ---

    ```python
    model.ewma_model(lambda_ewma=0.94)
    ```

    Third method: ff3()
    - This method retrieves Fama French 3 factors (market, size, value) for a particular date range and frequency. 
    The Fama French 3 factors, retrieved from Ken French's data library, are widely used in finance for risk factor model development. 
    The three factors are market factor, size factor (SMB - Small Minus Big), and value factor (HML - High Minus Low).
      - if freq == "daily":
        url = 'https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_daily_CSV.zip'
      - elif freq == "weekly":
        url = 'https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_weekly_CSV.zip'
      - elif freq == "monthly":
        url = 'https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_CSV.zip'
    ---

    ```python
    ff3 = model.ff3(start_date = '2018-01-01', end_date = "2023-03-03", freq = "daily")
    ff3 = ff3.loc[returns.index]
    ```

    Fourth method: sharpeDiag()
    - Implements Sharpe's diagonal model, a prominent strategy for asset allocation, using the provided returns. 
    This method calculates factor exposures (betas), which may be conditional for GARCH and EWMA models, 
    and uses them to transform asset positions directly into factor positions. 
    Unlike mcModelDrawPortRets(), this does not estimate the variance-covariance matrix derived from the mapping procedure. (idiosyncratic variances are ignored here)
    ---

    > Some example of the sharpeDiag() method:
    ```python
    model.sharpeDiag(mappingRets = ff3, vol = "simple", warning = False)
    model.sharpeDiag(mappingRets = ff3[["MKT","HML"]], vol = "garch", p = 1, q =1,  warning = False)
    model.sharpeDiag(mappingRets = ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94 , warning = False)
    ```

    Fifth method: mcModelDrawPortRets()
    - Conducts Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio returns. If the 'moving_average' method is selected for expected return calculation, 
    it draws returns from a normal distribution based on that mean.
    The function supports several ways to estimate sigma: using the Sharpe Diagonal method (which estimates the variance-covariance matrix mapping 
    to either one or more factors) with volatility models "simple", "GARCH", or "EWMA". Alternatively, if 'sharpeDiag' is False, the estimation relies on the returns themselves.
    ---
    > ### Note: This method, above all, is greatly influenced by the time span of analysis.
    > ### When using the EquityPrmPort class and this method, it's crucial to download or utilize returns from an appropriate time span.
    #

    > Some example of the mcModelDrawPortRets() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag = False, vol = "ewma", mu = "zero", lambda_ewma=0.95, warning= False)
    model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag= True, mappingRets = ff3, vol = "garch", p = 1, q = 1, warning= False)
    model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets = ff3[["HML", "SMB"]], vol = "garch", p = 1, q = 1, warning= False)
    ```

    Sixth method: mcModelRetsSimu()
    - This method employs Monte Carlo simulations to assess portfolio returns. It allows simulations to be grounded either on the Sharpe Diagonal model or directly on the actual portfolio returns. The method leverages Cholesky Decomposition to handle correlated returns among various assets in the portfolio. When 'sharpeDiag' is set to True, the function modifies its approach slightly from the standard sharpeDiag() method. It determines the variance-covariance matrix from the mapping process, factoring in the estimation of idiosyncratic variances to ensure the matrix remains positive, semi-definite, and numerically stable. In this context, the Value at Risk (VaR) using the 'sharpeDiag' approach is derived via a Monte Carlo simulation with an assumed zero mean. This technique has proven to produce a VaR closely aligned with the pure sharpeDiag() method, especially for more extensive portfolios.
    ---

    > Some example of the mcModelRetsSimu() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(sharpeDiag = False, vol = "garch", p=1,q=1, warning= False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3["MKT"], vol = "simple", warning= False)
    ```

    Seventh method: MargVars()
    - Implements the calculation of Marginal Value at Risk (MVaR) for individual assets in the portfolio using either Sharpe's Diagonal model or the portfolio returns directly.
    This methos accommodates different volatility models, including "simple", "GARCH", and "EWMA".
    The Marginal VaR measures the change in the VaR of a portfolio due to an increase of 1 unit in a specific asset, keeping all other positions constant.
    ---

    > Some example of the MargVars() method:
    ```python
    model.MargVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3["MKT"], vol = "simple", warning= False)
    model.MargVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)
    model.MargVars()
    ```

    Eighth method: RelCompVars()
    - Implements the calculation of Component Value at Risk relative to the total VaR of the portfolio, using either Sharpe's Diagonal model or the portfolio returns directly.
    This method supports various volatility models, including "simple", "GARCH", and "EWMA".
    The Relative Components VaRs provide insight into the proportion (%) of total risk that each asset contributes.
    ----

    > Some example of the RelCompVars() method:
    ```python
    model.RelCompVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3["MKT"], vol = "simple", warning= False)
    model.RelCompVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)
    model.RelCompVars()
    ```

    Ninth method: CompVars()
    - Implements the calculation of Component Value at Risk, using either Sharpe's Diagonal model or the portfolio returns directly.
    This method supports various volatility models, including "simple", "GARCH", and "EWMA".
    The Components VaRs provides insight into the proportion of total risk (currency) that each asset contributes.
    ---

    > Some example of the CompVars() method:
    ```python
    model.CompVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3["MKT"], vol = "simple", warning= False)
    model.CompVars(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)
    model.CompVars()
    ```

    Tenth method: VarEsMinimizer()
    - This method carries out an optimization of portfolio positions with the goal of minimizing the portfolio's Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
    It accommodates a range of volatility models ("simple", "GARCH", or "EWMA") and can use either the Sharpe's Diagonal model or the portfolio returns directly
    for the optimization process. When 'sharpeDiag' is enabled, the function calculates the variance-covariance matrix, which includes the idiosyncratic variance, from the mapping procedure. 
    This ensures the matrix is positive semi-definite, thereby enhancing numerical stability.
    The VaR is then computed via a Monte Carlo simulation with a mean of zero, offering a result closely mirroring the outcome of the pure sharpeDiag() approach, particularly for larger portfolios. This function allows the option to include or exclude short positions in the optimization process.
    ---

    > ### Note: If `allow_short` is set to `False`, this means that the method doesn't allow short selling of assets.
    > ### When the total position of the portfolio is negative and short selling isn't allowed, the method faces a dilemma. It's trying to optimize the portfolio without changing the total position, and without the flexibility of short selling to adjust holdings. 
    > ### As a result, the method might converge to a sub-optimal solution.
    # 

    > Some example of the VarEsMinimizer() method:
    ```python
    model.VarEsMinimizer(sharpeDiag = False, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma = 0.94, warning= False)
    model.VarEsMinimizer(vol = "simple", warning= False)
    ```
    > The VaR resulting from the minimization process must be compared within the same framework of analysis.
    - Before the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelRetsSimu(sharpeDiag = False, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma = 0.94, warning= False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - After the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.VarEsMinimizer(sharpeDiag = False, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma = 0.94, warning= False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - ### *It's important to highlight that all parameters have been kept consistent: (sharpeDiag = False, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma = 0.94, warning= False)*
    - ### *This consistency guarantees comparable and significant outcomes.*
    ###
    
    Eleventh method: kupiec_test()
    - Performs the Kupiec test of unconditional coverage to verify the accuracy of the VaR model.
    The Kupiec test compares the number of exceptions (instances where the losses exceed the VaR estimate)
    with the expected number of exceptions. Under the null hypothesis, the number of exceptions is consistent
    with the VaR confidence level.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.kupiec_test(num_stocks_s = num_stocks_s, S0_initial_s = S0_initial_s, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```

    Twelfth method: christoffersen_test()
    - Performs the Christoffersen test of independence to verify the accuracy of the VaR model.
    The Christoffersen test assesses the independence of exceptions. Under the null hypothesis, exceptions
    (instances where the losses exceed the VaR estimate) are independently distributed over time.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.christoffersen_test(num_stocks_s = num_stocks_s, S0_initial_s = S0_initial_s, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```

    Thirteenth method: combined_test()
    - Performs a combined Kupiec and Christoffersen test to assess the accuracy of the VaR model.
    The combined test applies both the Kupiec test of unconditional coverage and the Christoffersen test of independence to the exceptions. 
    The null hypothesis is that the VaR model is accurate.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelDrawPortRets(sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets= ff3, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, warning= False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.combined_test(num_stocks_s = num_stocks_s, S0_initial_s = S0_initial_s, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha_test = 0.05)
    ```

## 2. `derivative_models` 

The `derivative_models` module is engineered to perform comprehensive calculations for Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) specifically for equity-related derivatives and other derivatives that take their value from and underlying asset. Similar to the equity_models module, it incorporates both non-parametric and parametric methodologies for risk assessment.

For non-parametric approaches, the classes DerivaNprmSingle and DerivaNprmPort are available for individual derivative contracts and derivative portfolios, respectively. These non-parametric methods are versatile and can be adapted for various types of derivatives in future development.

On the parametric side, the module includes specialized classes for European and American options (EuOptionRmSingle, AmOptionRmSingle, EuOptionRmPort, AmOptionRmPort) as well as for equity forwards and futures (EquityForwardSingle, EquityFutureSingle, EquityForwardPort, EquityFuturePort).

The module contains the following classes:

1. `DerivaNprmSingle`

    This class is designed to model Non-Parametric Risk Measures for a single derivative position. The class performs calculations
    for the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using either the quantile or bootstrap method.
    Furthermore, this class also allows for fitting the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to the right-hand tail 
    of the loss distribution to perform an Extreme Vlue Theory (EVT) analysis.

    > The interval of the VaR/Es calculation follows the frequency of the provided returns.
    
    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - returns: Array with returns for the single derivative position.
    - position: The position on the single derivative. A positive value indicates a long position, a negative value indicates a short position.  
      - The position you possess can be determined by multiplying the single derivative's present-day price by the quantity you hold.
    - alpha: The significance level for the risk measure calculations (VaR and ES). Alpha is the probability of the
    occurrence of a loss greater than or equal to VaR or ES. Default is 0.05.
    - method: The method to calculate the VaR and ES. The possible values are "quantile" or "bootstrap". Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: (default=10000) The number of bootstrap samples to use when method is set to "bootstrap". Default is 1000.

    Methods
    --------
    - summary(): Returns a dictionary containing the summary of the calculated risk measures.
    - evt(): Performs an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) analysis by fitting the Generalized Pareto Distribution 
    to the right-hand tail of the loss distribution. Returns the calculated VaR and ES under EVT along with the shape and scale parameters of the fitted GPD.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - var: float: The calculated Value at Risk.
    - es: float: The calculated Expected Shortfall.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:
    > #### Historical return data for options on specific assets is typically not freely available online in the same way that stock price data is.
    > #### To emulate historical return data for a derivative position, we can generate synthetic data based on a normal distribution.
    > #### Although this doesn't represent actual market conditions, it provides a framework for analysis or testing.

    ```python
    # importing the NumPy library for numerical operations
    import numpy as np

    # change this with the historical returns of the derivative position

    # generating an array of 1000 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution, to simulate returns
    deri_returns = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000) / 100

    # DerivaNprmSingle class
    from pyriskmgmt.derivative_models import DerivaNprmSingle
    model = DerivaNprmSingle(returns = deri_returns, position = -5682.584, alpha = 0.05, method = "quantile")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Single Derivative Position:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Calculates and returns a summary of various risk measures for the given derivative position.
    This method calculates the maximum loss, maximum excess loss (over VaR), maximum loss over VaR, 
    and the Expected Shortfall over VaR. These measures are used to give an overall picture of the risk 
    associated with the derivative position. All these measures are rounded off to 4 decimal places for readability.
    ---

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    - Performs Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to estimate risk measures such as VaR (Value at Risk) 
    and ES (Expected Shortfall). The EVT estimates are calculated using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)
    and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
    EVT is a method used to assess the risk of extreme events. It is particularly useful for estimating the risk 
    of rare events that are not well-represented in the available data.
    ---

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

---
2. `DerivaNprmPort`

    The `DerivaNprmPort` class is a non-parametric risk management class designed to provide risk measures for a portfolio of derivatives' positions.
    The non-parametric approach does not rely on any assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of derivatives returns.

    - alpha: The significance level for VaR and ES calculations. Default is 0.05.
    - method: A method to be used for the VaR and ES calculations. The options are "quantile" for quantile-based VaR and ES calculation or "bootstrap" for a 
    bootstrap-based calculation. Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: The number of bootstrap samples to be used when the bootstrap method is selected. This is ignored when the quantile method is selected. Default is 1000.

    --------
    - summary(): Provides a summary of the risk measures, including VaR, Expected Shortfall (ES), Maximum Loss, Maximum Excess Loss, and ratios of these measures.
    - evt(): Provides risk measures using Extreme Value Theory (EVT). This is a semi-parametric approach that fits a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to the tail 
    of the loss distribution.
    - MargVars(): Provides the marginal VaRs for each derivative position in the portfolio. This is calculated as the change in portfolio VaR resulting from a small 
    change in the position of a specific derivative.
    
    Attributes

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:
    > #### Historical return data for options on specific assets is typically not freely available online in the same way that stock price data is.
    > #### To emulate historical return data for a derivative position, we can generate synthetic data (a matrix in this case) based on a normal distribution.
    > #### Although this doesn't represent actual market conditions, it provides a framework for analysis or testing.

    ```python
    # importing the NumPy library for numerical operations
    import numpy as np

    # change this with the historical returns (matrix) of the derivative positions

    # generating an array of 1000*5 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution, to simulate returns
    deri_returns_matrix = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(1000, 5)) / 100

    # defining initial monetary positions for each of the 5 assets
    # for every derivative: number of derivatives * today's price
    positions = [-2564.54, 5816.849, 2684.19, -26011.289, 2248.655]

    # DerivaNprmPort class
    from pyriskmgmt.derivative_models import DerivaNprmPort
    model = DerivaNprmPort(returns = deri_returns_matrix, positions = positions, alpha = 0.05, method = "quantile")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Portfolio of Derivative:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Computes various non-parametric risk metrics for the portfolio of derivatives and returns them in a dictionary.
    ---

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    - Estimates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using the Extreme Value Theory (EVT).
    EVT is used for assessing risk for extreme events. This function implements both quantile-based and bootstrap-based 
    methods for EVT.
    ---

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

    Third method: MargVars()
    > only available if self.method = "quantile"
    - Computes the Marginal Value at Risk (MVaR) for each derivative in the portfolio using a non-parametric approach.
    MVaR measures the rate of change in the portfolio's VaR with respect to a small change in the position of a specific derivative. 
    This method works by perturbing each derivative's position by a small amount (proportional to 1/scale_factor), calculating the new VaR,
    and measuring the difference from the original VaR. The result is an array of MVaRs, one for each derivative.

    ```python
    model.MargVars(scale_factor= 0.2)
    ```

---
3. `EuOptionRmSingle`

    EuOptionRmSingle provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the risk of European options using the Black-Scholes methodology.
    This class facilitates the calculation of both call and put option prices, their respective Greeks, and a suite of popular risk measures via various methods.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------

    where a violation occurs when the actual return is less than the predicted VaR.
    - combined_test(): Combines the Kupiec and Christoffersen tests to provide a comprehensive evaluation of Value at Risk (VaR) model accuracy.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # importing necessary libraries for numerical operations, financial data fetching, and random number generation
    import numpy as np; import yfinance as yf; import random

    # defining the stock ticker for Tesla
    ticker = ["TSLA"]

    # downloading historical stock data for Tesla between 2021-01-01 and 2023-01-01 with daily intervals and without progress indication
    data = yf.download(ticker, start='2021-01-01', end= "2023-01-01", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # downloading another set of historical stock data for Tesla between 2023-01-01 and 2023-08-08 for testing purposes
    test_data = yf.download(ticker, start='2023-01-01', end="2023-08-08", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting only the 'Adj Close' prices from both sets of data
    close_prices = data['Adj Close']

    First method: DeltaNormal()
    - DeltaNormal computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a European option, using the Delta-Normal method, 
    based on the provided input parameters. This method supports various volatility estimation techniques,  such as simple historical volatility, GARCH (p, q), and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA).
    ---

    > Some example of the DeltaNormal() method:
    ```python
    model.DeltaNormal(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05,  warning = False)
    model.DeltaNormal(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, vol = "garch", p = 2, q =2, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Second method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - HistoricalSimulation computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a European option using the historical simulation method, 
    based on the provided input parameters. 
    The method leverages past return scenarios to simulate future option positions, then derives risk measures from these simulated outcomes.
    ---

    ```python
    model.HistoricalSimulation(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Third method: mcModelDrawReturns()
    - mcModelDrawReturns computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a European option using a Monte Carlo simulation method based on historical returns and user-specified parameters for volatility and mean calculations. The method generates a series of possible future returns using a Monte Carlo approach, simulates the option's behavior under these return scenarios, and then extracts risk measures from these simulations.
    ---

    > Some example of the mcModelDrawReturns() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, vol = "ewma", mu = "constant", alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelDrawReturns(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, vol = "garch", mu = "zero", alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Fourth method: mcModelGbm()
    - The mcModelGbm method computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a European option using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) 
    Monte Carlo simulation model. The method projects future stock prices with GBM, simulates option prices based on these stock prices, 
    and then derives risk measures (VaR and ES) from the simulated option prices.
    ---

    > Some example of the mcModelGbm() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, vol = "ewma", mu = "constant", alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, vol = "garch", mu = "zero", alpha = 0.05,warning = False)
    ```

    Fifth method: kupiec_test()
    - kupiec_test performs the Kupiec's Proportional Of Failures (POF) test for backtesting the accuracy of VaR predictions. The test assesses if the number of 
    times the losses exceed the VaR prediction is consistent with the confidence level used to compute the VaR. If the number of exceptions is too high, 
    it indicates that the VaR measure may be understating the risk.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.kupiec_test(num_options = num_options, contract_size = contract_size, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, interval = 1,  alpha = 0.05, alpha_test = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Sixth method: christoffersen_test()
    - The christoffersen_test method conducts Christoffersen's Conditional Coverage test for backtesting the accuracy of VaR predictions. The test examines both the 
    unconditional coverage (like Kupiec's POF) and the independence of exceptions. The test checks if exceptions are clustering or if they occur independently 
    over time. It uses a likelihood ratio method to compare the likelihood of observing the given sequence of exceptions under the assumption of independent 
    exceptions versus the likelihood under the observed conditional probabilities.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.christoffersen_test(num_options = num_options, contract_size = contract_size, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, interval = 1,  alpha = 0.05, alpha_test = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Seventh method: combined_test()
    - The combined_test method conducts a combined backtesting test using both Kupiec's POF and Christoffersen's Conditional Coverage tests. This test leverages both 
    the POF test which tests for correct unconditional coverage and the conditional coverage test that checks for the independence of exceptions. By 
    combining the results of these two tests, the combined_test provides a more robust way to assess the accuracy of VaR predictions.
    The combined_test calls both the kupiec_test and christoffersen_test methods and aggregates their results. The combined likelihood ratio is derived 
    from summing the individual likelihood ratios from both tests. The chi-square test's critical value used here has 2 degrees of freedom, reflecting 
    the combination of the two individual tests.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelGbm(num_options = num_options,contract_size = contract_size, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.combined_test(num_options = num_options, contract_size = contract_size, S0_initial = S0_initial, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, interval = 1,  alpha = 0.05, alpha_test = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

4. `AmOptionRmSingle`

    The AmOptionRmSingle class is designed to calculate the price and several Risk Measures of an American option using the binomial model. 
    
    The class handles both call and put options. If the computed price from the binomial model is lower than the European 
    option price (calculated using the Black-Scholes model), the class uses the European option price instead. This decision 
    was made necessary due to the computational cost of using a large-scale binomial model.
     
    This accounts for the fact that American option prices cannot be less than the prices of 
    their European counterparts due to the additional early exercise feature of American options.
    
    > This is not a high-frequency trading (HFT) package.
    > Therefore, approximations (TRADE-OFF) to the order of '0.00x' are considered acceptable for its applications.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - K: Strike price of the option.
    - T: Time to expiration (in years assuming 252 trading days). For instance: for a 8-day contract use 8/252
    - S0: Initial stock price at the time t = 0.    
    - r: Risk-free interest rate (annualized).
    - sigma: Volatility of the stock price (annualized).
    - option_type: Type of the option. Acceptable values are 'call' for call options and 'put' for put options.

    -------
    - HistoricalSimulation(): Computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using historical simulations based on past return scenarios.
    - mcModelDrawReturns(): Computes the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by simulating future stock returns using a Monte Carlo method based on various 
      statistical models for volatility and mean returns.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - bi_price : The calculated option price using the binomial model. If this price is less than the Black-Scholes price, then the Black-Scholes price is used as the option price.

5. `EuOptionRmPort`

    The `EuOptionRmPort` class provides a comprehensive risk management tool designed to evaluate the Value at Risk (VaR) 
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) for portfolios consisting of European options. Leveraging the Black-Scholes model, 
    it not only calculates the price for each option in the portfolio but also computes the Greeks, including Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho,
    given specific parameters. A DataFrame is constructed which provides a detailed summary of each option's type, its Black-Scholes price, and associated Greeks.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - K_s: An array of strike prices for each option in the portfolio. Represents the price at which the option can be exercised.
    - T_s: An array of time to maturities for each option. Specifies the time remaining until the option contract is due for expiration.
      - For instance: expDays = np.array([5,8,12,15,18]); T_s = expDays/252
    - S0_s: An array of initial spot prices for the underlying asset for each option. It represents the current market value of the asset which the option derives its value from.
    - r_s: An array of risk-free interest rates for each option (annualized). The risk-free rate represents a theoretical rate of return on an investment with zero risk.
    - sigma_s: An array of volatilities for the underlying asset for each option (annualized).
    - option_type_s: An array indicating the type of each option (e.g., 'call' or 'put'). A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset, 
    while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.

    Methods
    -------
    - HistoricalSimulation(): Calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using historical simulations based on past return scenarios.
    - ff3(): Fetches data for the Fama-French three-factor (FF3) model, which includes Market return (MKT), Size (SMB: Small Minus Big), and Value (HML: High Minus Low) from Ken French's Data Library.
    - mcModelDrawReturns(): Determines the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by simulating correlated future stock returns using a Monte Carlo method, 
      rooted in various statistical models for volatility and mean returns.
    - VarEsMinimizer(): seeks to minimize the Value at Risk (VaR) for a given portfolio of European options using historical simulations.
    - kupiec_test(): Conducts the Kupiec backtest for Value at Risk (VaR). The Kupiec test employs a likelihood ratio test to validate VaR model accuracy.
    - christoffersen_test(): Implements the Christoffersen test for Value at Risk (VaR), which examines the clustering of violations where actual returns underperform the predicted VaR.
    - combined_test(): Merges the Kupiec and Christoffersen tests, delivering a holistic assessment of Value at Risk (VaR) model precision.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - bs_prices: An array with the calculated Black-Scholes option prices.
    - summary : A pandas DataFrame summarizing each option's type, its Black-Scholes price, and associated Greeks.

    Notes
    -----
    All input arrays (`K_s`, `T_s`, `S0_s`, `r_s`, `sigma_s`, `option_type_s`) must share the same length as they correspond to 
    attributes for each option in the portfolio. The `fit` method is activated by default during the initialization to generate the necessary values and populate the summary DataFrame.

    First method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - Performs a historical simulation method for the computation of VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a portfolio of European options. 
    The method uses historical returns of the underlying asset to simulate potential future returns and subsequently calculates the VaR and ES based
    on the distribution of the simulated profits and losses.

    Second method: ff3()
    - This method retrieves Fama French 3 factors (market, size, value) for a particular date range and frequency. 
    The Fama French 3 factors, retrieved from Ken French's data library, are widely used in finance for risk factor model development. 
    The three factors are market factor, size factor (SMB - Small Minus Big), and value factor (HML - High Minus Low).

    Third method: mcModelRetsSimu()
    - Simulates returns using Monte Carlo models and calculates the Value-at-Risk (VaR) 
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) based on specified configurations.
    To utilize Sharpe diagnostics, ensure 'sharpeDiag' is set to True and 'mappingRets' is provided.
    When 'sharpeDiag' is enabled, the variance-covariance matrix of underlying returns is calculated using a mapping procedure from n factors,
    incorporating the estimation of idiosyncratic variance to ensure the matrix is positive and semi-definite and numerical stability.
    'num_sims' simulations of joint returns (correlated) will be used to estimate the Risk Measures.

    ```

    Forth method: VarEsMinimizer()
    - Optimizes the number of options in a portfolio to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    using historical simulation over a specified interval.
    The optimization process maintains the overall portfolio position and can allow or disallow short positions based on the 'allow_short' parameter.
    ---

    ```python
    model.VarEsMinimizer(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```
    > The VaR resulting from the minimization process must be compared within the same framework of analysis.
    - Before the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.HistoricalSimulation(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - After the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.VarEsMinimizer(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - ### *It's important to highlight that all parameters have been kept consistent: (num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)*
    - ### *This consistency guarantees comparable and significant outcomes.*

    Fifth method: kupiec_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio by applying the Kupiec test, which uses a likelihood ratio to compare the 
    predicted and actual exceptions.
    The Kupiec test uses a likelihood ratio to assess whether the number of actual exceptions is consistent 
    with the VaR model's predictions.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR =  model.HistoricalSimulation(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.kupiec_test(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, S0_initial_s = S0_initial_s, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05,alpha_test = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Sixth method: christoffersen_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio using the Christoffersen test, a test that focuses on the independence of 
    exceptions over time. It utilizes the likelihood ratio to examine if the clustering of exceptions is statistically significant.
    The Christoffersen test evaluates the clustering of exceptions, providing insight into the independence of VaR breaches.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR =  model.HistoricalSimulation(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```

    ```

    Seventh method: combined_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio by combining results from both the Kupiec and the Christoffersen tests. 
    This combined approach aims to capture the advantages of both individual tests, providing a more comprehensive assessment 
    of VaR performance.
    The test performs the Kupiec test and the Christoffersen test individually and combines their results to offer a more 
    robust backtesting assessment. The combined likelihood ratio from both tests is then used to make a decision regarding 
    the performance of the VaR model.

6. `AmOptionRmPort`

    The `AmOptionRmPort` class provides a comprehensive risk management tool designed to evaluate the Value at Risk (VaR) 
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) for portfolios consisting of American options, leveraging the Binomial Lattice model.
    At each step, it is assumed that the underlying asset will move either up or down by a certain percentage with a given probability. 
    This results in a binomial tree representation of possible future asset prices.
    A DataFrame is constructed which provides a detailed summary of each option's type and its Binomial-Model price.

    ---
    > #### Please ensure the following prerequisites are met:
    > - An active R environment is required.
    > - The 'rmgarch' package must be installed in your R environment.

    > 2. Run the 'install.packages("rmgarch")' command within your R environment.
    ---
    > Here below a test function to see if R and the "rmgarch" package is installed in the machine you are using.
    ```python
    from pyriskmgmt.SupportFunctions import TestR
    TestR()
    ```
    > If you're working with this package in Google Colab or another cloud-based notebook, follow the steps in three consecutive cells to install the 'rmgarch' package.

    ```python 
    !sudo apt-get install -y libmpfr-dev
    ```
    ```python
    !R -e "install.packages('rmgarch')"
    ```
    Be advised: the installation of "rmgarch" might take close to 8 minutes due to its extensive dependencies.

    Methodology
    ------------
    1. The function sets up a binomial tree with a user-specified number of time steps (steps) leading up to the option's expiration.

    2. The probability of an upward stock price movement (denoted as 'p') and downward movement (denoted as '1-p') are derived in a risk-neutral framework.
    The derivation depends on the risk-free rate, the volatility of the underlying asset, and the time step duration.

    3. The formulas for these probabilities are:
        - u (up factor) = e^(sigma * sqrt(dt))
        - d (down factor) = 1/u
        - p (probability of an up movement) = (e^(r * dt) - d) / (u - d)
        Where:
            - r = risk-free rate
            - sigma = volatility of the underlying
            - dt = T/steps (duration of a step, with T being the time to expiration)

    4. Starting at the final nodes of the tree (maturity), the option values are computed based on their intrinsic value. For a call option, it's max(S-K, 0) and for a put option, 
    it's max(K-S, 0), where S is the stock price and K is the strike price.

    5. The function then recursively calculates the option price at each prior node by discounting the expected future option values from the two possible succeeding nodes 
    (up and down nodes).

    6. For American options, at each node, the function also checks if exercising the option immediately provides a higher value than holding it.
    If so, the value from immediate exercise is used.

    7. The price of the American option is found at the root of the tree.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - K_s: An array of strike prices for each option in the portfolio. Represents the price at which the option can be exercised.
    - T_s: An array of time to maturities for each option. Specifies the time remaining until the option contract is due for expiration.
      - For instance: expDays = np.array([5,8,12,15,18]); T_s = expDays/252
    - S0_s: An array of initial spot prices for the underlying asset for each option. It represents the current market value of the asset which the option derives its value from.
    - r_s: An array of risk-free interest rates for each option (annualized). The risk-free rate represents a theoretical rate of return on an investment with zero risk.
    - sigma_s: An array of volatilities for the underlying asset for each option (annualized). 
    - option_type_s: An array indicating the type of each option (e.g., 'call' or 'put'). A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset, 
    while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.

    Methods
    -------
    - HistoricalSimulation(): Calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using historical simulations based on past return scenarios.
    - ff3 (): Fetches data for the Fama-French three-factor (FF3) model, which includes Market return (MKT), Size (SMB: Small Minus Big), 
        and Value (HML: High Minus Low) from Ken French's Data Library.
    - mcModelDrawReturns(): Determines the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by simulating correlated future stock returns using a Monte Carlo method, 
      rooted in various statistical models for volatility and mean returns.
    - VarEsMinimizer(): seeks to minimize the Value at Risk (VaR) for a given portfolio of European options using historical simulations.
    - kupiec_test(): Conducts the Kupiec backtest for Value at Risk (VaR). The Kupiec test employs a likelihood ratio test to validate VaR model accuracy.
    - christoffersen_test(): Implements the Christoffersen test for Value at Risk (VaR), which examines the clustering of violations where actual returns underperform the predicted VaR.
    - combined_test(): Merges the Kupiec and Christoffersen tests, delivering a holistic assessment of Value at Risk (VaR) model precision.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - bi_prices : Array of option prices calculated using the binomial lattice model. This attribute is populated after calling the `fit` method.
    - summary : A DataFrame containing a summary of each option's type, binomial model price, strike price, time to maturity, initial spot price, risk-free rate, and volatility. 

    Notes
    -----
    All input arrays (`K_s`, `T_s`, `S0_s`, `r_s`, `sigma_s`, `option_type_s`) must share the same length as they correspond to 
    attributes for each option in the portfolio. 
    The `fit` method is activated by default during the initialization to generate the necessary values and populate the summary DataFrame.

    Additional Notes
    -----------------
    - In some methods of this class, for computational reasons, this class employs the QuantLib library package instead of a custom-built binomial tree. 

    - Utilizing the QuantLib library's well-optimized tools can provide more efficient and accurate results, especially for complex 
    option structures or when high computational performance is needed.

    - In that case: 
        1. The function begins by setting the calculation date to today's date.
        2. The Null calendar (which assumes no holidays) and the Actual365Fixed day count convention are used.
        3. The option type is determined (either call or put).
        4. Using the provided time to maturity, the exercise date is computed.
        5. An American exercise is defined, which signifies that the option can be exercised any time before or on the expiration date.
        6. With all the necessary components (payoff, exercise type, underlying spot, risk-free rate, and volatility), a Black-Scholes process is initiated.
        7. The BinomialVanillaEngine, specifically with the "eqp" method (equal probabilities), is then applied to this process. 
        The number of steps provided defines the tree's granularity.
        8. Once the pricing engine is set, the Net Present Value (NPV) of the option is computed, giving the option's price.

    # adjusting the last observed stock price by the random percentages to generate strike prices
    K_s = S0_s * (1 + random_percentages)

    # generating random integers between 10 and 20, then converting them to time to maturity in years

    ```

    First method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - Performs a historical simulation method for the computation of VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a portfolio of American options. 
    The method uses historical returns of the underlying asset to simulate potential future returns and subsequently calculates the VaR and ES based on the distribution of the simulated profits and losses.

    - The computation of American option prices within the simulation relies on QuantLib's BinomialVanillaEngine, which is based on the binomial tree model.
    - This model provides a discrete-time approximation for the option pricing. 

      - The specifics of this method are:
      1. Set the calculation date to today's date.
      2. Use the Null calendar and Actual365Fixed day count convention.
      3. Determine the option type (either call or put).
      4. Compute the exercise date using the provided time to maturity.
      5. Define an American exercise.
      6. Initiate a Black-Scholes process with the required components.
      7. Apply the BinomialVanillaEngine with the "eqp" method and the provided number of steps.
      8. Compute the option's Net Present Value (NPV) for its price.

    <br>

    - Moreover, an essential step in this simulation is a comparison between the price from QuantLib's method and the standard Black and Scholes model:
    - Whenever the QuantLib price is lower than the Black and Scholes price, the latter is used.
    - This difference has been tested, and its magnitude is minor (on average 0.00xxx). However, it is an approximation.
    - The focus of this package is Risk Management, not HFT (High-Frequency Trading), making this a good compromise in terms of computational costs.

    Second method: ff3()
    - This method retrieves Fama French 3 factors (market, size, value) for a particular date range and frequency. 
    The Fama French 3 factors, retrieved from Ken French's data library, are widely used in finance for risk factor model development. 
    The three factors are market factor, size factor (SMB - Small Minus Big), and value factor (HML - High Minus Low).

    ```

    Third method: mcModelRetsSimu()
    - Simulates returns using Monte Carlo models and calculates the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) based on specified configurations. 
    
    - >  A significant feature of this function is the approximation mechanism applied to adjust American option prices.

      - Here's a detailed breakdown:

      1. Utilizing the Binomial and Black-Scholes Models:
      The method takes into account both the Binomial Model prices and the Black-Scholes prices for American options.
      The Black-Scholes model is a foundational tool for derivatives traders, but it doesn't consider early exercise of options. 
      The Binomial model, on the other hand, can handle early exercise and is particularly suited for American options. 
      However, calculating American option prices using the Binomial model can be computationally expensive, especially for large steps in the tree. 
      This leads us to the core idea of the approximation.

      2. Introducing the Approximation Mechanism:
      To optimize speed without compromising too much on accuracy, an approximation ratio (ratio_bi_bs) is calculated from the prices derived from these two models.
      Essentially, for each option, this ratio represents the TODAY's relationship of its Binomial Model price to its Black-Scholes price. 
      This is an innovative way to approximate American option prices, borrowing strengths from both models.

      3. Ensuring Robustness against Zero Division and NaN:
      To ensure that the method remains robust and doesn't falter due to mathematical anomalies, there are layers of checks integrated:
      - First Layer: Direct comparison to zero. If either the Binomial Model price or the Black-Scholes price for an option is zero, the ratio is set to 1. 
      This avoids potential division by zero.
      - Second Layer: After calculating the ratios, any resulting NaN (Not-a-Number) value, which can arise due to divisions like 0/0, is also set to 1.
      NaN values can cause unpredictable behavior and setting them to 1 ensures stability in the calculations.
      The essence of this approximation is to quickly and efficiently estimate the prices of American options while taking into account the variations
      and peculiarities of both the Binomial and Black-Scholes models. This mechanism enables faster risk calculations, making it a valuable asset in time-sensitive financial scenarios.

    > Some examples of the mcModelRetsSimu() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets = ff3, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets = ff3,vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma=0.94, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, vol = "ewma", p = 1, q = 1, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning= False)
    ```

    Forth method: VarEsMinimizer()
    - Optimizes the number of options in a portfolio to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    using historical simulation over a specified interval.
    The optimization process maintains the overall portfolio position and can allow or disallow short positions based on the 'allow_short' parameter.
    - The pricing of American options is often close to that of European options, especially when the 
    option is not deeply in or out of the money and when there's a substantial amount of time until expiration.
    - Given this closeness in pricing, and for computational efficiency, we use the European option prices to minimize the Value-at-Risk (VaR). 
    - This allows us to leverage faster techniques available for European options, providing a good approximation for risk minimization of American options.
    ---

    ```python
    model.VarEsMinimizer(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```
    > The VaR resulting from the minimization process must be compared within the same framework of analysis.
    - Before the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.HistoricalSimulation(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - After the minimization process:
    ```python
    VaR = model.VarEsMinimizer(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    VaR
    ```
    - ### *It's important to highlight that all parameters have been kept consistent: (num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)*
    - ### *This consistency guarantees comparable and significant outcomes.*
    ###

    Fifth method: kupiec_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio by applying the Kupiec test, which uses a likelihood ratio to compare the 
    predicted and actual exceptions.
    The Kupiec test uses a likelihood ratio to assess whether the number of actual exceptions is consistent 
    with the VaR model's predictions.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR = model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_options_s = num_options_s, contract_size_s = contract_size_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, vol = "ewma", lambda_ewma = 0.94, interval = 1, alpha = 0.05, warning= False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python

    ```

    Sixth method: christoffersen_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio using the Christoffersen test, a test that focuses on the independence of 
    exceptions over time. It utilizes the likelihood ratio to examine if the clustering of exceptions is statistically significant.
    The Christoffersen test evaluates the clustering of exceptions, providing insight into the independence of VaR breaches.

    ```

    Seventh method: combined_test()
    - Backtests the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio by combining results from both the Kupiec and the Christoffersen tests. 
    This combined approach aims to capture the advantages of both individual tests, providing a more comprehensive assessment 
    of VaR performance.
    The test performs the Kupiec test and the Christoffersen test individually and combines their results to offer a more 
    robust backtesting assessment. The combined likelihood ratio from both tests is then used to make a decision regarding 
    the performance of the VaR model.

7. `EquityForwardSingle`

    This class offers tools to assess and compute the VaR and ES at the maturity of forward contracts, 
    critical in derivative trading and risk management. The two risk assessment techniques 
    include historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. 

    Additionally, a Kupiec backtest is integrated for evaluating the accuracy of the VaR predictions, crucial for regulatory and internal risk assessment purposes.
    The forward price is calculated considering the spot price of the equity, a prevailing risk-free interest rate, 
    any anticipated dividend yield, and the time left to the contract's maturity. 

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - S0: Initial spot price of the equity.
    - T: Time to maturity in years. For instance: for a 8-day contract use 8/252.
    - r: Risk-free interest rate as a decimal in annual terms (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    - dividend_yield: Dividend yield of the equity as a decimal (annual continuous dividend yield). Default is 0.

    Methods
    -------
    - HistoricalSimulation(): Employs historical simulation to determine Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for forward contracts using past underlying asset returns.
    - mcModelGbm(): Simulates potential equity price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model and computes the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
    for a forward contract.
    - kupiec_test(): Applies the Kupiec backtest to assess the accuracy of the VaR model by comparing actual vs. expected exceptions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - forward_price : Calculated forward price considering the spot price of the equity, prevailing risk-free interest rate, anticipated dividend yield, and time 
    left to the contract's maturity.
    - interval : Interval calculated by multiplying the time to maturity (T) by 252 (commonly used number of trading days in a year). Useful for scaling the time to maturity to daily intervals.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:

    ```python

8. `EquityFutureSingle`

    This class provides a comprehensive toolkit for traders and financial analysts to compute and assess the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    specifically focused on the maturity of future contracts, a pivotal aspect in derivative trading and risk management.

    Incorporating two primary risk assessment techniques, this package allows for a dual approach:
    1. Historical Simulation: Harnessing the power of past data to provide insights into potential future risks.
    2. Monte Carlo Simulation using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Model: This method adopts stochastic processes to simulate potential 
    future stock price movements and provide a probabilistic estimate of future risks.

    For enhanced reliability in the risk management process, a Kupiec backtest has been integrated. This backtest is vital for not just 
    internal evaluations but is also aligned with regulatory requirements, ensuring that the VaR predictions stand up to rigorous testing.

    To ensure practical applicability, the future price calculation has been designed to factor in various real-world parameters like the spot price of the equity, 
    a prevailing risk-free interest rate, anticipated dividend yields, and the precise time left to a contract's maturity.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - S0: Initial spot price of the equity.
    - T: Time to maturity in years. For instance: for a 8-day contract use 8/252.
    - r: Risk-free interest rate as a decimal in annual terms (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    - dividend_yield: Dividend yield of the equity as a decimal (annual continuous dividend yield). Default is 0.
    - convenience_yield: : This is more common in the context of commodities. It's the non-monetary advantage or premium associated with holding an asset in its 
    physical form as opposed to a derivative form (annual continuous convenience yield). Default is 0.
    - storage_cost:  This refers to the costs associated with storing a physical commodity. This is relevant for futures pricing and is part of the cost of carry in financial models (annual continuous storage cost). Default is 0.

    Decision to Omit Margin Calls
    ------------------------------
    While the concept of margin calls is integral in many trading scenarios, this package has intentionally omitted it. The reasons are multifold:
    - Simplification: This package is designed as a foundational tool. Including margin calls might increase the complexity for users unfamiliar with the concept.
    - Customization: By providing a basic framework, users have the flexibility to enhance and build upon the package, integrating more sophisticated methods like 
    margin calls if they deem necessary.
    - Focus: The primary aim is to give a clear perspective on market risks, specifically from adverse price movements. Integrating margin calls might divert from this core focus.

    Methods
    -------
    - HistoricalSimulation(): Employs historical simulation to determine Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for forward contracts using past underlying asset returns.
    This method utilizes the mark-to-market approach and transports the P&L to maturity using the risk-free rate.
    - mcModelGbm(): Simulates potential equity price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model and computes the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    for forward contracts. Similar to the HistoricalSimulation method, this too incorporates the mark-to-market approach and adjusts the P&L to maturity using the risk-free rate.
    - kupiec_test(): Applies the Kupiec backtest to assess the accuracy of the VaR model by comparing actual vs. expected exceptions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - future_price: Calculated future price considering the spot price of the equity, prevailing risk-free interest rate, anticipated dividend yield, convenience yield, storage costs, 
    and time left to the contract's maturity.
    - interval: Interval calculated by multiplying the time to maturity (T) by 252 (commonly used number of trading days in a year). Useful for scaling the time 
    to maturity to daily intervals.

9. `EquityForwardPort`

    This class offers tools to assess and compute the VaR (Value-at-Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall) at the maturity of a portfolio of forward contracts, 
    which is fundamental in derivative trading and risk management. The risk assessment techniques for the portfolio 
    can include methods like historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation using the Cholesky decomposition of the VCV.
    The class calculates the VaR and ES that will occur at the maturity of the last forward contracts in the portfolio. 
    It also moves money through time using the risk-free rate, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of potential future risks.

    Additionally, a Kupiec backtest can be integrated for evaluating the accuracy of the VaR predictions for the portfolio, 
    which is pivotal for regulatory and internal risk assessment purposes.

    The forward prices for the portfolio are calculated considering the spot prices of the equities, the prevailing risk-free interest rates, 
    any anticipated dividend yields, and the times left to the contracts' maturities.

    - summary: A DataFrame containing summarized information for each forward contract in the portfolio.
    This includes columns like 'ForwardPrice', 'S0', 'T', 'interval', 'r', and possibly 'dividend_yield', providing a comprehensive overview of the portfolio.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # importing required libraries for financial data, numerical operations, and randomization
    import yfinance as yf; import numpy as np; import random

    # defining a list of tickers for Microsoft, Apple, General Electric, and Tesla
    tickers = ["MSFT", "AAPL", "GE", "TSLA"]

    # downloading historical stock data for the given tickers between 2021-01-01 and 2023-01-01 with daily intervals and without progress indication
    data = yf.download(tickers, start='2021-01-01', end= "2023-01-01", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # downloading another set of historical stock data for the given tickers between 2023-01-01 and 2023-08-08 for testing purposes
    test_data = yf.download(tickers, start='2023-01-01', end="2023-08-08", progress=False, interval="1d")

    # extracting only the 'Adj Close' prices from both sets of data
    close_prices = data['Adj Close'] 
    close_prices_test = test_data['Adj Close']

    # finding the last closing price from historical data and the first closing price from the test data
    S0_s = close_prices.tail(1).values.ravel()
    S0_initial_s = close_prices_test.head(1).values.ravel()

    # generating random integers between 10 and 20, then converting them to time to maturity in years

    dividend_yield_s = np.random.uniform(1, 2.5, len(tickers)) / 100

    # generating random integers between -100 and 100 to represent the number of forwards for each contract
    num_forward_s = np.random.randint(-100, 100, len(tickers))

    for i in range(len(num_forward_s)):
      if num_forward_s[i] == 0: num_forward_s[i] = 50

    # generating random contract sizes between 5 and 10 for each ticker

    print("Parametric VaR-ES for a Portfolio of Forward Contracts:")
    print("Forward Prices:", model.forward_prices)
    print("Summary")
    print(model.summary)
    ```

    First method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - This method assumes that the user provides synchronized inputs, i.e., the order of `num_forward_s`, `underlying_rets`, and the internal attributes of the class should be consistent. If not, the results might not be accurate.
    The computations heavily depend on reshaping and realigning the input data structures to ensure synchronized calculations. 
    The method uses extensive matrix operations for efficiency.
    The method computes the VaR and ES at the expiration of the last forward contract. It also accounts for each contract's maturity and adjusts potential gains or losses using the corresponding risk-free rate.
    ---

    ```python
    model.HistoricalSimulation(num_forward_s = num_forward_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

    Second method: ff3()
    - This method retrieves Fama French 3 factors (market, size, value) for a particular date range and frequency. 
    The Fama French 3 factors, retrieved from Ken French's data library, are widely used in finance for risk factor model development. 
    The three factors are market factor, size factor (SMB - Small Minus Big), and value factor (HML - High Minus Low).
      - if freq == "daily":
        url = 'https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_daily_CSV.zip'
      - elif freq == "weekly":

    ff3 = ff3.loc[underlying_rets.index]
    ```

    Third method: mcModelRetsSimu()
    - The `mcModelRetsSimu` function simulates Monte Carlo model returns based on specified configurations, accounting for 
    various risk metrics. The function assumes that all inputs, including `num_forward_s`, `underlying_rets`, and other parameters, are synchronized and in order. The extensive matrix operations embedded within the function are utilized for efficiency 
    and precision. However, the onus of providing synchronized data rests on the user.

    1. Data Processing:
    - It aligns and orders the underlying return data as per each forward contract's interval.
    - Simulated final prices of the underlying assets are deduced, based on various intervals.
    - The function crafts a 4D data structure by either stacking or expanding these simulated prices to facilitate synchronized computations.
    2. Profit and Loss Calculation:
    - P&L scenarios are calculated for every forward contract. Adjustments are made in line with the maturity and the risk-free rate of each contract.
    - P&L is derived from the discrepancy between the simulated final prices and the forward prices, taking into account whether the position is long or short.
    3. Risk Metrics Calculation:
    - VaR and ES are computed based on the amassed P&L scenarios. The VaR is determined as a P&L distribution quantile, considering the specified significance level alpha.
    - ES, on the other hand, represents the average of the losses surpassing the computed VaR.
    4. Output:
    - The final output is a dictionary encompassing the computed VaR and ES values, the maximum and minimum expiration intervals of the forward contracts, and the total number of simulated P&L scenarios.
    ---

    > Some examples of the mcModelRetsSimu() method:
    ```python
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_forward_s = num_forward_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, alpha = 0.05,  sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets = ff3[["MKT","SMB"]], vol = "ewma",lambda_ewma = 0.94, warning = False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_forward_s = num_forward_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, alpha = 0.05,  sharpeDiag = True, mappingRets = ff3[["MKT","SMB"]], vol = "garch", p =1, q =1, warning = False)
    model.mcModelRetsSimu(num_forward_s = num_forward_s, underlying_rets = underlying_rets, alpha = 0.05,  sharpeDiag = False, vol = "simple", warning = False)
    ```

    Forth method: kupiec_test()
    - The `kupiec_test` method performs the Kupiec test for the backtesting of Value at Risk (VaR). This test focuses on verifying whether the number of exceptions (times the losses exceed VaR) matches the expected number given a confidence level.
    The method processes input data, checks and ensures that the forward contracts and returns are synchronized, and computes the P&L scenarios. It then calculates the number of exceptions and compares the observed exceptions against the expected ones using a likelihood ratio test.
    ---

    > VaR to be tested
    ```python
    VaR =  model.HistoricalSimulation(num_forward_s = num_forward_s,underlying_rets = underlying_rets, alpha = 0.05, warning = False)["var"]
    ```
    ```python
    model.kupiec_test(num_forward_s = num_forward_s, S0_initial_s = S0_initial_s, test_returns = test_returns, var = VaR, alpha = 0.05, alpha_test = 0.05, warning = False)
    ```

10. `EquityFuturePort`

    This class offers tools to assess and compute the VaR (Value-at-Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall) at the maturity of a portfolio of futures contracts 
    integral to derivatives trading and risk management. The risk assessment techniques for the portfolio incorporate methods 
    such as historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation using the Cholesky decomposition of the VCV. 
    The class calculates the VaR and ES set to occur at the maturity of the last future contract in the portfolio. It emphasizes the market-to-market approach, 
    reflecting the continuous revaluation of contracts to account for daily price changes. The class also integrates the notion of moving money through time 
    using the risk-free rate, enhancing the understanding of potential future risks.
    
    A Kupiec backtest can be integrated for evaluating the accuracy of the VaR predictions for the portfolio, critical for both regulatory and internal risk assessment.
    The future prices for the portfolio consider the equities' spot prices, prevailing risk-free interest rates, any expected dividend yields, convenience yields, storage costs, 
    and the times left to the contracts' maturities.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - S0_s: Array of initial spot prices of the equities in the portfolio.
    - T_s: Array of times to maturity in years for the contracts in the portfolio.
      - For instance: expDays = np.array([5,8,12,15,18]); T_s = expDays/252
    - r_s: Array of risk-free interest rates as decimals for the contracts in the portfolio in annual terms (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    - dividend_yield_s: Array of dividend yields for each equities in the portfolio as decimals (annual continuous dividend yields). Default is None.
    - convenience_yield_s: Array of the contracts' convenience yields in the portfolio as decimals (annual convenience dividend yields). Default is None.
    - storage_cost_s: Array of the contracts' storage costs in the portfolio as decimals (annual storage costs). Default is None.

    Decision to Omit Margin Calls
    ------------------------------
    - Notably, this class does not factor in margin calls. In futures trading, margin calls occur when the value of an investor's margin account falls below the broker's required amount.
    When the account value drops below the margin requirement, brokers demand that the investor deposit additional money to cover the potential loss. 
    This ensures that the account is always sufficiently funded to cover the contract's obligations. 
    However, in the context of this class, the emphasis is placed squarely on evaluating the inherent market risk of a portfolio of futures.
    By focusing on market risk, the class prioritizes understanding the potential shifts in portfolio value due to market factors, without the added complexity of
    handling margin requirements and associated cash flows. As such, while margin calls are pivotal in real-world futures trading, ensuring appropriate levels of
    funds and managing daily changes, their exclusion here allows users to concentrate on the primary goal: assessing market risk in a streamlined manner.

    - Furthermore, it's essential to note that the `EquityFuturePort` class serves as a foundational package, designed with extensibility in mind. 
    While the current version prioritizes the evaluation of market risk without the intricacies of margin calls, this design choice does not limit the potential of the package.
    Developers and risk management professionals can leverage this foundational structure to build upon it, introducing more advanced features or specific modifications
    tailored to unique requirements. By starting with a streamlined and focused version, the package offers a clean slate, 
    reducing the initial learning curve and providing a clear path for enhancements. This modularity ensures that the class can evolve to cater to a broader spectrum
    of risk management needs, with the possibility of integrating margin calls or other advanced features in subsequent iterations, 
    depending on the evolving requirements of the derivatives trading community.

    First method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - This method employs a historical simulation approach to compute the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) 
    for a portfolio of future contracts at the expiration of the last future contract. The method leverages daily mark-to-market 
    (MTM) P&L computations, adjusting them through time using the risk-free rate. Synchronization and consistency of the provided

    The function assumes that all inputs, including `num_future_s`, `underlying_rets`, and other parameters, are synchronized and in order. The extensive matrix operations embedded within the function are utilized for efficiency 
    and precision. However, the onus of providing synchronized data rests on the user.

    1. Data Processing:
    The method sorts and reorders the return data based on the expiration interval of each future contract. It then 
    simulates final prices for the underlying assets based on the corresponding intervals. This results in a synchronized 4D data 
    structure of simulated prices.
    2. Profit and Loss Calculation:
    The method computes the daily mark-to-market (MTM) P&L scenarios for each future contract, adjusting them across time 
    using the associated risk-free rate. P&L is derived from the differences between simulated final prices and futures 
    prices, considering the position (long or short) of each contract.
    3. Risk Metrics Calculation:
    The aggregated P&L scenarios are used to compute VaR and ES. VaR is the quantile of the P&L distribution at the given 
    significance level alpha. ES represents the average of the losses exceeding the computed VaR.
    4. Output:
    Returns a dictionary encompassing the calculated VaR and ES, maximum and minimum expiration intervals of the future 
    contracts, and the total number of simulated P&L scenarios.

## 3. `fixed_income_models` 

The `fixed_income_models`  module specializes in calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for fixed-income securities using both non-parametric and parametric methods.
For non-parametric risk assessment, the classes `FixedIncomeNprmSingle` and `FixedIncomeNprmPort` are tailored for individual fixed-income securities and fixed-income portfolios, respectively.
On the parametric side, `FixedIncomePrmSingle` and `FixedIncomePrmPort` offer a more structured approach to evaluating risks associated with individual fixed-income securities and portfolios.
Additionally, the `YieldCurve` class serves a specific function of downloading and interpolating the yield curve from treasury.gov, which is critical for understanding the risk and return characteristics of fixed-income securities.

The module includes the following classes:

1. `FixedIncomeNprmSingle`

    This class is designed to model Non-Parametric Risk Measures for a single fixed-income position. The class performs calculations
    for the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using either the quantile or bootstrap method.
    Furthermore, this class also allows for fitting the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to the right-hand tail 
    of the loss distribution to perform an Extreme Vlue Theory (EVT) analysis.

    > The interval of the VaR/Es calculation follows the frequency of the provided returns.
    
    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - returns: Array with returns for the single fixed-income position.
    - position: The position on the single fixed-income security. A positive value indicates a long position, a negative value indicates a short position.  
      - The position you possess can be determined by multiplying today's price of the fixed-income security by the quantity you hold.
    - alpha: The significance level for the risk measure calculations (VaR and ES). Alpha is the probability of the
    occurrence of a loss greater than or equal to VaR or ES. Default is 0.05.
    - method: The method to calculate the VaR and ES. The possible values are "quantile" or "bootstrap". Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: The number of bootstrap samples to use when method is set to "bootstrap". Default is 10000.

    Methods
    --------
    - summary(): Returns a dictionary containing the summary of the calculated risk measures.
    - evt(): Performs an Extreme Value Theory (EVT) analysis by fitting the Generalized Pareto Distribution 
    to the right-hand tail of the loss distribution. Returns the calculated VaR and ES under EVT along with the shape and scale parameters of the fitted GPD.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - var: float: The calculated Value at Risk.
    - es: float: The calculated Expected Shortfall.

    Example
    -------
    Setting up the class:
    > #### Historical return data for a specific fixed-income security is typically not freely available online in the same way that stock price data is.
    > #### To emulate historical return data for a fixed-income position, we can generate synthetic data based on a normal distribution.
    > #### Although this doesn't represent actual market conditions, it provides a framework for analysis or testing.

    ```python
    # importing the NumPy library for numerical operations
    import numpy as np

    # change this with the historical returns of the fixed-income position

    # generating an array of 1000 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution, to simulate returns
    fixed_income_returns = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000) / 100

    # FixedIncomeNprmSingle class
    from pyriskmgmt.fixed_income_models import FixedIncomeNprmSingle
    model = FixedIncomeNprmSingle(returns = fixed_income_returns, position = 5682.584, alpha = 0.05, method = "quantile")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Single Fixed-income Position:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Calculates and returns a summary of various risk measures for the given asset.
    This method calculates the maximum loss, maximum excess loss (over VaR), maximum loss over VaR, and the Expected Shortfall over VaR. These measures are used to give an overall picture of the risk 
    associated with the asset. All these measures are rounded off to 4 decimal places for readability.

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    -  Performs Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to estimate risk measures such as VaR (Value at Risk) 
    and ES (Expected Shortfall). The EVT estimates are calculated using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
    EVT is a method used to assess the risk of extreme events. It is particularly useful for estimating the risk of rare events that are not well-represented in the available data.
    ----

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

2. `FixedIncomeNprmPort`

    The `FixedIncomeNprmPort` class is a non-parametric risk management class designed to provide risk measures for a portfolio of fixed-income positions.
    The non-parametric approach does not rely on any assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of the fixed-income securities returns. 

    > The interval of the VaR/Es calculation follows the frequency of the provided returns.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - returns: A numpy array of fixed-income positions returns.
    - positions: A list of fixed-income positions.
      - For each bond: the position you possess can be determined by multiplying the bond's present-day price by the quantitiy you hold.
    - alpha: The significance level for VaR and ES calculations. Default is 0.05.
    - method: A method to be used for the VaR and ES calculations. The options are "quantile" for quantile-based VaR and ES calculation or "bootstrap" for a 
    bootstrap-based calculation. Default is "quantile".
    - n_bootstrap_samples: The number of bootstrap samples to be used when the bootstrap method is selected. This is ignored when the quantile method is selected.
    Default is 10000.

    Methods
    --------
    - summary(): Provides a summary of the risk measures, including VaR, Expected Shortfall (ES), Maximum Loss, Maximum Excess Loss, and ratios of these measures.
    - evt(): Provides risk measures using Extreme Value Theory (EVT). This is a semi-parametric approach that fits a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to the tail 
    of the loss distribution.
    - MargVars(): Provides the marginal VaRs for each bond position in the portfolio. This is calculated as the change in portfolio VaR resulting from a small 
    change in the position of a specific fixed-income security.
    
    Attributes
    ---------
    - var: The calculated Value at Risk (VaR) for the portfolio.
    - es: The calculated Expected Shortfall (ES) for the portfolio.
    - port_returns: Cumulative returns of the portfolio based on the fixed-income positions returns. 

    Example
    -------

    Setting up the class:
    ```python
    # importing the NumPy library for numerical operations
    import numpy as np

    # change this with the historical returns (matrix) of the fixed-income positions

    # generating an array of 1000*5 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution, to simulate returns
    fixed_income_returns_matrix = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(1000, 5)) / 100

    # defining initial monetary positions for each of the 5 bonds
    # for every bond: number of bonds * today's price
    positions = [-2564.54, 5816.849, 2684.19, -26011.289, 2248.655]

    # FixedIncomeNprmPort class
    from pyriskmgmt.fixed_income_models import FixedIncomeNprmPort
    model = FixedIncomeNprmPort(returns = fixed_income_returns_matrix, positions = positions, alpha = 0.05, method = "quantile")

    print("Non-parametric VaR-ES for a Portfolio of Fixed-income Securities:")
    print("VaR:",model.var)
    print("Es:",model.es)
    ```

    First method: summary()
    - Computes various risk metrics for the portfolio and returns them in a dictionary.
    ---

    ```python
    model.summary()
    ```

    Second method: evt()
    - Estimates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using the Extreme Value Theory (EVT).
    EVT is used for assessing risk for extreme events. This function implements both quantile-based and bootstrap-based methods for EVT.
    ----

    ```python
    model.evt(alpha = 0.025, quantile_threshold = 0.95)
    ```

    Third method: MargVars()
    - Computes the Marginal Value at Risk (MVaR) for each asset in the portfolio using a non-parametric approach.
    MVaR measures the rate of change in the portfolio's VaR with respect to a small change in the position of a specific asset. 
    This method works by perturbing each asset's position by a small amount (proportional to 1/scale_factor), calculating the new VaR,
    and measuring the difference from the original VaR. The result is an array of MVaRs, one for each asset.
    ---

    > only available if self.method = "quantile"
    ```python
    model.MargVars(scale_factor = 0.3)
    ```

3. `YieldCurve`

    This class provides functionalities for fetching, plotting, and interpolating the U.S. Treasury yield curve data. 
    The yield curve represents the relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity of a debt for a borrower in a given currency.
    The curve is a critical indicator in financial markets, often used as a benchmark for other interest rates, and provides insights into future economic conditions.

    - https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value

    - The downloaded yield curve will have a DataFrame structure, where the columns are time to maturity in months and the values are interest rates in percentages. 
    For example, a value of 5.37 represents an interest rate of 5.37%.

    ```
    | Date      |   1  |   2  |   3  |  6   |  12  |  24  |  36  |  60  |  84  |  120 |  240 |  360 |
    |-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
    | 01/03/2022| 0.05 | 0.06 | 0.08 | 0.22 | 0.40 | 0.78 | 1.04 | 1.37 | 1.55 | 1.63 | 2.05 | 2.01 |
    | 01/04/2022| 0.06 | 0.05 | 0.08 | 0.22 | 0.38 | 0.77 | 1.02 | 1.37 | 1.57 | 1.66 | 2.10 | 2.07 |
    ...
    | 08/28/2023| 5.56 | 5.53 | 5.58 | 5.56 | 5.44 | 4.98 | 4.69 | 4.38 | 4.32 | 4.20 | 4.48 | 4.29 |
    | 08/29/2023| 5.54 | 5.53 | 5.56 | 5.52 | 5.37 | 4.87 | 4.56 | 4.26 | 4.21 | 4.12 | 4.42 | 4.23 |

    ```
    > Zero-Coupon Bond (ZCB) Pricing Example
    > ----------------------------------------
    > One application of this yield curve data is in pricing zero-coupon bonds (ZCBs). 
    > - Let fix the yield for a 24-month maturity at 4.87%, and the face value of the ZCB at $1000.
    > - The price of a ZCB, calculated using the well-known formula, would be:
      > - Price = Face Value / (1 + (Yield / 100))^Time to Maturity = $1000 / (1 + (4.87 / 100))^2 = $909.28

      <br>
    
    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - years_back : Number of years back for which to fetch yield curve data. Default is set to 2.

    Methods:
    --------
    - PlotYieldCurve(): Plots the yield curve using seaborn and matplotlib. Accepts optional figsize argument to adjust the size of the plot.
    - InterpolateYieldCurve(): Interpolates the yield curve using either linear interpolation or cubic spline. 
    Optionally only interpolates the yield curve for today.

    Attributes
    ----------
    yield_curve_df : DataFrame containing fetched yield curve data.
    today : Today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
    yield_curve_today : Series containing yield curve data for today.
    
    Example
    -------

    Setting up the class:

    ```python
    # YieldCurve class
    from pyriskmgmt.fixed_income_models import YieldCurve
    model = YieldCurve(years_back=2)

    print("")
    print("Yield Curve")
    print(model.yield_curve_df)
    print("Yield Curve Today")
    print(model.yield_curve_today)
    ```

    First method: PlotYieldCurve()
    - Plots the yield curve data for today using seaborn and matplotlib.
    This method takes the yield_curve_today Series attribute to plot a line graph, representing the yield curve for the 
    specified date. The x-axis indicates the time to maturity in months, and the y-axis indicates the yield in percentage.
    ---

    ```python
    model.PlotYieldCurve(figsize=(15, 4))
    ```

    Second method: InterpolateYieldCurve()
    - Interpolates the yield curve data to provide more granular time-to-maturity points. 
    Interpolation can be performed either for the yield curve of today or for all historical yield curve data in the DataFrame.
    The method offers two interpolation techniques: linear interpolation and cubic spline interpolation.
    ---

    > Interpolation of the entire curve
    ```python
    interpolated_data = model.InterpolateYieldCurve(method= "cubic_spline", yield_curve_today=True)
    ```
    > Interpolation of today's yield curve
    ```python 
    interpolated_data = model.InterpolateYieldCurve(method= "linear", yield_curve_today=False)
    ```

4. `FixedIncomePrmSingle`

    This class provides the functionalities to price fixed-income securities, specifically bonds, and calculate their 
    associated risk metrics such as duration, yield-to-maturity, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES). 
    
    Important
    ---------
    - Due to the constraint in how the 'maturity' parameter is designed, it can only accept either an integer value representing full years or a decimal value
    like 0.5 to indicate semi-annual periods. 
    - As a result of this constraint, the class is designed to assist in evaluating the risk and return of a bond position at the time of the bond's issuance or
    just after a coupon payment in the case of a coupon-bearing bond. For a zero-coupon bond, it is meant to be used either at the time of issuance or
    every six months thereafter.
    The class supports both zero-coupon bonds (ZCB) and coupon-bearing bonds, with the option for annual or semi-annual payments.

    > For other types of Bond this module offers a NON-PARAMETRIC APPROACH: FixedIncomeNprmSingle() 

    Purpose
    -------
    This class aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding and analyzing fixed-income securities. It is designed to serve two main audiences:

    1. Those who are looking to further develop or integrate more complex calculations and risk management strategies. 
    This class offers a reliable basis upon which additional features and functionalities can be built.
    
    2. Those who intend to use the class within its given boundaries for straightforward pricing and risk assessment of fixed-income securities.
    For this audience, the class provides ready-to-use methods for calculating key metrics like bond price, duration, yield-to-maturity, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES).

    - By catering to both of these needs, the class offers a flexible and robust starting point for a range of fixed-income analysis and risk management tasks.

    Initial Parameters
    ------------------
    - yield_curve_today : The DataFrame containing the current yield curve, with terms in months as columns and the yield rates as row values.
    The yield rates should be represented as a percentage, e.g., 3% should be given as 3.

    ```
    | Date      |   1  |   2  |   3  |  4   |  5   | ...  | 355  |  356 |  357 |  358 |  359 |  360 |
    |-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
    | 08/29/2023| 5.54 | 5.53 | 5.52 | 5.51 | 5.51 | 4.87 | 4.56 | 4.26 | 4.21 | 4.19 | 4.18 | 4.19 |
    ```

    - maturity: The time to maturity of the bond in years. Must be either an integer value for full years or a decimal value like 0.5 to indicate semi-annual periods.

    Default is None.
    - semi_annual_payment: Indicator to specify if the bond pays coupons semi-annually (required if is_zcb is set to False).
    Default is None.

    Methods
    -------
    - DurationNormal(): Calculates the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) of a bond position using a normal distribution model.
    This method assumes a normal distribution of yield changes and uses the modified duration of the bond
    to approximate the change in bond price for a given change in yield.
    - HistoricalSimulation(): In this approach, historical data is used to generate a distribution of potential outcomes,
    which can be more realistic compared to model-based approaches like the Duration-Normal method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    - bond_price: The price of the bond calculated based on either zero-coupon or coupon-bearing.
    - duration: The Macaulay duration of the bond (in years).
    - modified_duration: The modified duration of the bond (in years).
    - yield_to_maturity: Yield to maturity of the bond (yearly).

    Exceptions
    ----------
    - Raises an exception if the coupon_rate and semi_annual_payment are not provided when is_zcb is set to False.
    - Raises an exception if the maturity provided is beyond the highest maturity available in the yield_curve_today DataFrame.
    - Raises an exception if the maturity provided ends with .5, is_zcb is False and semi_annual_payment is not True.

5. `FixedIncomePrmPort`

    This class offers the functionalities for pricing and risk assessment of a portfolio of bond securities. 
    It not only facilitates the calculation of portfolio-level risk metrics such as duration, yield-to-maturity, Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES),
    but also provides the same metrics for each individual bond within the portfolio.

    Important Features and Constraints
    ----------------------------------
    1. `maturity_s` Array Parameter:
    - Accepts either integer values to represent full years or decimals like 0.5 for semi-annual periods.
    - Optimized for risk and return evaluation at specific time-points: either at the time of issuance or 
      just after a coupon payment for coupon-bearing bonds.
    
    2. Alignment Within Maturities:
    - The class is designed to account for alignment within the maturities of the bonds in the portfolio.
    - The system in place requires every bond to either mature or have its subsequent payment due in intervals that are multiples of six months.
    - While this is a limitation since it doesn't account for bonds with non-standard payment schedules or already issued ones, it provides a base that future developers can build upon to create more advanced evaluation mechanisms.
    - Therefore, optimal usage is at the time of issuance of all bonds bond or every six months thereafter.
    
    3. Bond Compatibility:
    - Compatible with portfolios that include both zero-coupon bonds and coupon-bearing bonds.
    - Provides options for annual or semi-annual coupon payments for coupon-bearing bonds.
  
    > For other types of Bond Portofolio this module offers a NON-PARAMETRIC APPROACH: FixedIncomeNprmPort()

    First method: DurationNormal()
    - This method calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a given bond position using the Modified Duration mapping approach.
    ---

    > Some examles of the DurationNormal() method:
    ```python
    model.DurationNormal(yield_curve = yield_curve,vol = "simple", interval = 25, alpha = 0.05)
    model.DurationNormal(yield_curve = yield_curve,vol = "garch", interval = 25, p = 1, q = 1, alpha = 0.05)
    model.DurationNormal(yield_curve = yield_curve,vol = "ewma", interval = 25, lambda_ewma = 0.95, alpha = 0.05)
    ```

    Second method: HistoricalSimulation()
    - In this approach, historical data is used to generate a distribution of potential outcomes, which can be more realistic compared to model-based approaches like the Duration-Normal method.
    ---

    ```python
    model.HistoricalSimulation(yield_curve = yield_curve,interval = 25, alpha = 0.05)
    ```
